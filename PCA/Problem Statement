Goals

Given a time of day (and maybe some other features, including weather), predict how crowded the gym will be.
Figure out which features are actually important, which are redundant, and what features could be added to make the predictions more accurate.

Data

The dataset consists of 26,000 people counts (about every 10 minutes) over the last year.
In addition, I gathered extra info including weather and semester-specific information that might affect how crowded it is.
The label is the number of people, which I'd like to predict given some subset of the features.

Here the problem is of regression type so we are going to use linear regression as our basline model, 
followed by decision tree regressor, randomforest regressor and Xgboost regressor.
We will train and test on all of them, once with original data and after Box Cox transformation.
Here I will carry out PCA on Box Cox Transformed data as it has better accuracy and compare all the results.
