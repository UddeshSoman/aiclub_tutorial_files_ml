Crowd at Gym Data:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nsrose7224/crowdedness-at-the-campus-gym


The dataset consists of 26,000 people counts (about every 10 minutes) over the last year.
In addition, I gathered extra info including weather and semester-specific information that might affect how crowded it is.
The label is the number of people, which I'd like to predict given some subset of the features.
